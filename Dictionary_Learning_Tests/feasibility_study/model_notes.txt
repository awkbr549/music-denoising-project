learnDictionaryMini(train,'solo_acapella_176-212',500,'lars',10000)
didn't finish overnight
10000 is large batch size, closer to full dictionary learning

learnDictionaryMini(train,'solo_acapella_176-212',500,'cd',1000)
for comparison to 500-lars-1000
maybe cd is fater

this one has max_iter set to 5000, so maybe no convergence warning
